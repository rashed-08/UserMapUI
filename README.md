# AngularTemplate
The AngularTemplate is aimed to reduce time while setup angular project.\

# How it works? 
AngularTemplate will help you to headache creating angular project and start from scratch. The AngularTemplate uses default bootstrap 4.3. In case if you are interested update bootstrap version or want to use Material UI then simply remove bootstrap 4.3 and then take nessesary step to implement them.

# Installation 
Goto desired file system and open terminal to create folder.
mkdir ProjectName

Goto the folder
cd ProjectName

Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/rashed-08/AngularTemplate

To download all the dependencies
npm install (for debian user, if you get error then run sudo npm install)

# Run Project
Goto application folder
cd ~/AngularTemplate
Now run this command,
ng serve -o (Use '-o' flag for open up new tab in browser)

N:B:
This is my own setup approach. May you can choose other project structure.
